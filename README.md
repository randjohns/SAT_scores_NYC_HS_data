 sample consists of public schools (including charter schools) in New 
York, NY.

This is one of the projects in the Dataquest.io curriculum and I enjoyed the chance to experiment with many tools such as Basemap. There was minimal guidance given for this project and it was exciting to try, fail, read lots of documentation, repeat..., and eventually succeed!

Enjoy,
